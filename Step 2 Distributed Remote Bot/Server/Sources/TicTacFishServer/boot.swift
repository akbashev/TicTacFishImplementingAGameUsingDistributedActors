Abstract:
The server-side Swift app that creates (on-demand) server-side bot players.
 Note that in this sample app they live forever, so we should implement some bounded
 lifecycle for them -- set up a deadline for a game to be played and then terminate
 the bot players to avoid them from lingering around forever.
